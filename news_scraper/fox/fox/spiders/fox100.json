It is also less stable than uranium and can more easily spark a dangerous nuclear chain reaction.", "But plutonium, like uranium, is a heavy element that is not easily dispersed in the air. It is the other byproducts of nuclear power generation, such as radioactive forms of cesium and iodine, that are more prone to spread and cause widespread contamination.", "Ed Lyman, a physicist at the activist group Union of Concerned Scientists, estimates the fuel in Unit 3 is 5 percent to 10 percent more dangerous than the fuel in the other crippled reactors.", "Still, it is very unlikely to become packed tightly enough to reach what is known as critical mass and start a chain reaction. The plutonium would qualify as weapons grade only if a large quantity was packed together.", "Here's how the uranium in a typical reactor turns into a mixture that includes plutonium:", "When the pellets of uranium dioxide inside the thin fuel rods are split to create energy in the reactor, they release neutrons that, in turn, create highly radioactive plutonium-239.

Berlusconi's now-defunct government already raised the value-added tax from 20 percent to 21 percent as part of earlier measures.", "In addition, the government adopted austerity measures worth euro20 billion and euro10 billion in measures aimed at boosting anemic Italian growth. They include pension reform, local government spending cuts, the reestablishment of a tax on a first house that was annulled by Berlusconi and new taxes on boats over 10 meters (30 feet) in length and on luxury cars, Grilli said.", "At the same time, the measures will reduce the tax on the cost of employment, give fiscal breaks to companies that invest to grow their businesses and increase investments in local public transport.", "Monti denied an impression that the measures mostly comprised new taxes.", "\"There are certainly taxes, we know that in Italy it is easier to reduce the deficit through new taxes than through cutting costs,\" Monti said. \"But what we did, for example, in terms of rebalancing the pension goes in the right structural direction.\"", "The government \"made a particular effort to make sure that higher taxes did not affect the usual suspects,\" Monti said.", "The premier spent the weekend briefing political parties, unions, business groups, consumer lobbies and others. Unions were particularly critical of the measures to reform the pension system, saying certain classes of workers, including those who do physical labor, shouldn't be forced to work extra years, and that women who enter the work force after raising children would have to work well into old age to meet seniority requirements.", "The measures raise the pension age to 66 years for men in 2012 and for women by 2018, and also increases to 42 years and one month the years of service for a man to retire with full benefits, 41 years and one month for a woman. Labor Minister Elsa Fornero said it would be possible to retire earlier, \"with a small penalty.\"", "Fornero wiped away a tear when she said that the pension reform would require sacrifices, including a hold on inflation adjustments for larger pensions.", "On the fight against tax evasion, Monti said there would be no more tax amnesties, a mechanism used frequently in the past to recover lost revenues. In addition, the measures imposed a 1.5 percent penalty on money that was repatriated in a recent scheme that allowed Italians who had concealed money abroad to repatriate it for a negligible 5 percent penalty.", "The measures also limit cash transactions to payments under euro1,000 -- down from euro2,500. In Italy, paying in cash is common as a way to conceal transactions from the government and avoid paying the value-added tax.", "After meeting with Monti earlier Sunday, the head of Italy's industrial lobby said that the survival of the common euro currency depends on Italy's coming up with very strong austerity and growth measures -- followed by a concerted effort at the European level so that Italian sacrifices are not in vain.", "Confindustria President Emma Marcegaglia described the measures as \"very heavy.\"", "The coming days \"will decided if the euro will survive or not. The first move to save the euro is in Italian hands, with a very strong measures,\" Marcegaglia said.
