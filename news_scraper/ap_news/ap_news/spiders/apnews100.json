Research shows the variant is at least twice as contagious as delta and at least four times as contagious as the original version of the virus.", "Omicron is more likely than delta to reinfect individuals who previously had COVID-19 and to cause \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d in vaccinated people while also attacking the unvaccinated. The World Health Organization reported a record 15 million new COVID-19 cases for the week of Jan. 3-9, a 55% increase from the previous week.", "Along with keeping comparatively healthy people out of work and school, the ease with which the variant spreads increases the odds the virus will infect and linger inside people with weakened immune systems - giving it more time to develop potent mutations.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the longer, persistent infections that seem to be the most likely breeding grounds for new variants,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have very widespread infection that you\u2019re going to provide the opportunity for that to occur.\u201d", "Because omicron appears to cause less severe disease than delta, its behavior has kindled hope that it could be the start of a trend that eventually makes the virus milder like a common cold.", "It\u2019s a possibility, experts say, given that viruses don\u2019t spread well if they kill their hosts very quickly. But viruses don\u2019t always get less deadly over time.", "A variant could also achieve its main goal - replicating - if infected people developed mild symptoms initially, spread the virus by interacting with others, then got very sick later, Ray explained by way of example.", "\u201cPeople have wondered whether the virus will evolve to mildness. But there\u2019s no particular reason for it to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can be confident that the virus will become less lethal over time.\u201d", "Getting progressively better at evading immunity helps a virus to survive over the long term. When SARS-CoV-2 first struck, no one was immune. But infections and vaccines have conferred at least some immunity to much of the world, so the virus must adapt.", "There are many possible avenues for evolution. Animals could potentially incubate and unleash new variants. Pet dogs and cats, deer and farm-raised mink are only a few of the animals vulnerable to the virus, which can potentially mutate within them and leap back to people.", "Another potential route: With both omicron and delta circulating, people may get double infections that could spawn what Ray calls \u201cFrankenvariants,\u201d hybrids with characteristics of both types.", "When new variants do develop, scientists said it\u2019s still very difficult to know from genetic features which ones might take off. For example, omicron has many more mutations than previous variants, around 30 in the spike protein that lets it attach to human cells. But the so-called IHU variant identified in France and being monitored by the WHO has 46 mutations and doesn\u2019t seem to have spread much at all.", "To curb the emergence of variants, scientists stress continuing with public health measures such as masking and getting vaccinated. While omicron is better able to evade immunity than delta, experts said, vaccines still offer protection and booster shots greatly reduce serious illness, hospitalizations and deaths.", "Anne Thomas, a 64-year-old IT analyst in Westerly, Rhode Island, said she\u2019s fully vaccinated and boosted and also tries to stay safe by mostly staying home while her state has one of the highest COVID-19 case rates in the U.S.", "\u201cI have no doubt at all that these viruses are going to continue to mutate and we\u2019re going to be dealing with this for a very long time,\u201d she said.", "Ray likened vaccines to armor for humanity that greatly hinders viral spread even if it doesn\u2019t completely stop it. For a virus that spreads exponentially, he said, \u201canything that curbs transmission can have a great effect.\u201d Also, when vaccinated people get sick, Ray said their illness is usually milder and clears more quickly, leaving less time to spawn dangerous variants.", "Experts say the virus won\u2019t become endemic like the flu as long as global vaccination rates are so low. During a recent press conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that protecting people from future variants \u2014 including those that may be fully resistant to today\u2019s shots \u2014 depends on ending global vaccine inequity.", "Tedros said he\u2019d like to see 70% of people in every country vaccinated by mid-year.

Separately, a September survey of 1,000 protestant pastors by the evangelical firm Lifeway Research found about half of congregations received roughly what they budgeted for last year, with 27% getting less than anticipated and 22% getting more.", "Hope Presbyterian Church in Austin, Texas, a largely upper-middle-class congregation of about 400, is among those that have enjoyed relative stability despite the pandemic.", "The Rev. Josh Robinson had expected contributions to drop off when in-person services paused for more than a year, but they remained steady. So have member pledges for upcoming gifts in 2022. Some in the congregation even donated their government stimulus checks to the church, which used them to set up a fund to provide direct financial assistance to those who lost income due to the pandemic.", "It all prompted the pastor to reexamine his own approach to the pandemic.", "\u201cI needed to step back and think, what did it mean for me as a spiritual leader to not have the same faith mindset, since I was anticipating a downturn?\u201d Robinson said. \u201cHere were the members of the church stepping up \u2014 I had to lean into that.

The memoir was a best-seller and a near-instant standard, the kind of work people would instinctively reach for after losing a loved one. Didion said she thought of the work as a testament of a specific time; tragically, \u201cMagical Thinking\u201d became dated shortly after it was published.

The old West where Manifest Destiny was an almost palpable notion that was somehow tied to the land and the climate and one\u2019s own family.\u201d", "Didion\u2019s subjects also included earthquakes, movie stars and Cuban exiles, but common themes emerged: the need to impose order where order doesn\u2019t exist, the gap between accepted wisdom and real life, the way people deceive themselves \u2014 and others \u2014 into believing the world can be explained in a straight, narrative line. Much of her nonfiction was collected in the 2006 book \u201cWe Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live,\u201d named after the opening sentence of her famous title essay from \u201cThe White Album,\u201d a testament to one woman\u2019s search for the truth behind the truth.", "\u201cWe look for the sermon in the suicide, for the social or moral lesson in the murder of five,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the \u2018ideas\u2019 with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.\u201d", "She was a lifelong explorer, writing about a trip to war torn El Salvador in the nonfiction \u201cSalvador,\u201d and completing \u201cA Book of Common Prayer\u201d after a disastrous trip to a film festival in Colombia in the early 1970s. \u201cSouth and West: From a Notebook,\u201d observations made while driving around the American South, came out in 2017, the same year nephew Griffin Dunne\u2019s documentary \u201cJoan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold\u201d was released. In 2019, the Library of America began compiling her work in bound volumes.", "Didion prided herself on being an outsider, more comfortable with gas station attendants than with celebrities. But she and her husband, whose brother was the author-journalist Dominick Dunne, were well placed in high society. In California, they socialized with Warren Beatty and Steven Spielberg among others and a young Harrison Ford worked as a carpenter on their house. They later lived in a spacious apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, knew all the right people and had a successful side career as screenwriters, collaborating on \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park,\u201d a remake of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and adaptations of \u201cPlay It As It Lays\u201d and his \u201cTrue Confessions.\u201d", "Born in 1934 in Sacramento, California and descended from pioneers who had traveled with the notorious Donner Party, Didion was fascinated by books from an early age. She was encouraged to write by her mother, as a way of filling time, and was especially impressed by the prose of Ernest Hemingway, whose terse rhythms anticipated her own. She was both shy and ambitious, inclined to solitude, but also determined to express herself through writing and public speaking. She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1956 and moved to New York for a job at Vogue after winning a writing contest sponsored by the magazine.", "Conservative in her early years, voting for Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964 and contributing essays to William F.

She was especially scathing about the quality of political reporting, mocking the \u201cinside baseball\u201d journalism of presidential campaigns and dismissing Bob Woodward\u2019s best-selling books as vapid and voyeuristic, \u201cpolitical pornography.\u201d", "Didion married Dunne, whom she had met at a dinner party, in 1964. Two years later, they adopted a baby girl, Quintana Roo. Author couples are notoriously combustible, whether the drunken brawl of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett or the infidelity and suicidal demons of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. But despite their own conflicts, Didion says she and Dunne grew and endured.", "\u201cWhatever troubles we had were not derived from being writers,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cWhat was good for one was good for the other.\u201d", "___", "Associated Press National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report."], "url": "https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-joan-didion-26c0f31d849f9303e9a6a782db840775"},

Thirteen of those were part of the \u201cVampire Chronicles\u201d begun with her 1976 debut. Long before \u201cTwilight\u201d or \u201cTrue Blood,\u201d Rice introduced sumptuous romance, female sexuality and queerness \u2014 many took \u201cInterview With the Vampire\u201d as an allegory for homosexuality \u2014 to the supernatural genre.", "\u201cI wrote novels about people who are shut out life for various reasons,\u201d Rice wrote in her 2008 memoir \u201cCalled Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession.\u201d \u201cThis became a great theme of my novels \u2014 how one suffers as an outcast, how one is shut out of various levels of meaning and, ultimately, out of human life itself.\u201d", "Born Howard Allen Frances O\u2019Brien in 1941, she was raised in New Orleans, where many of her novels were set.

", "text": ["WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Republicans are poised to use a filibuster to derail", ". The showdown will be the first vote this year when the GOP has used the delaying tactic to try killing major legislation.", "Yet while the GOP seemed certain to succeed Thursday, their victory may prod Democrats closer to curbing or eliminating a legislative tactic that\u2019s been the bane of Senate majorities since the Founding Fathers.", "Here\u2019s a look at the filibuster, how it works and the current political firestorm over it.", "WHAT\u2019S A FILIBUSTER?", "Unlike the House, the Senate places few constraints on lawmakers\u2019 right to speak. Senators can also easily use the chamber\u2019s rules to hinder or block votes. Collectively these procedural delays are called filibusters.", "Senate records say the term began appearing in the mid-19th century. The word comes from a Dutch term for \u201cfreebooter\u201d and the Spanish \u201cfilibusteros\u201d that were used to describe pirates.", "Filibusters were emblazoned in the public\u2019s mind in part by the 1939 film, \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u201d in which Jimmy Stewart portrayed a senator who spoke on the chamber\u2019s floor until exhaustion. In a real-life version of that, Sen. Strom Thurmond, D-S.C., stood continuously by his desk for 24 hours and 18 minutes speaking against the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the longest Senate speech by a single senator for which there are records of speaking length.", "Those days are mostly gone. Senators usually tell Senate leaders or announce publicly that they will filibuster a bill, with no lengthy speeches required. Their impact usually flows not from delaying Senate business but from the need to get a supermajority of votes to end them.", "HOW DO FILIBUSTERS END?", "Records from the first Congress in 1789 show senators complaining about long speeches blocking legislation. Frustration grew and in 1917, the Senate voted to let senators end filibusters with a two-thirds majority vote.", "In 1975, the Senate lowered that margin to the current three-fifths majority, which in the 100-member chamber is 60 votes. That margin is needed to end filibusters against nearly all types of legislation, but no longer applies to nominations.", "Democrats controlling the Senate in 2013, angered by GOP delays on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s picks, reduced the margin for ending filibusters against most appointees to a simple majority, exempting Supreme Court nominees. In 2017, Republicans running the chamber, eager to add conservative justices under then-President Donald Trump, lowered the threshold to a simple majority for Supreme Court picks as well.", "WHAT\u2019S THE PROBLEM?", "Democrats emerged from the 2020 elections controlling the White House, Senate and House. They had pent-up pressure to enact an agenda that includes spending trillions to bolster the economy and battle the pandemic, expanding voting rights and helping millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally become citizens.", "But Democrats have a slender House majority and control the 50-50 Senate only because of the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. That means that to overcome a filibuster, Democrats need support from at least 10 Republicans, a heavy lift in a time of intense partisanship.", "That\u2019s frustrated progressive senators and outside liberal groups, who\u2019ve pressured Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to eliminate filibusters \u2014 even as their use has become increasingly common by whichever party is in the minority.", "According to Senate records dating back to World War I, the number of votes to end filibusters in any two-year Congress never reached 100 until the 2007-2008 sessions. It hit a high of 298 in the 2019-2020 Congress, mostly on Trump appointees that Republicans running the Senate were pushing to confirmation.", "In this year\u2019s first five months as of this week, there were already 41 votes to end filibusters, mostly on President Joe Biden\u2019s nominees.", "WHAT CAN DEMOCRATS DO?", "It takes a simple majority, 51 votes, to change how the Senate cuts off filibusters. GOP support for retaining them is solid, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying Democrats want to end them in a quest for \u201craw power.\u201d", "But with Democrats eager to enact their priorities before they lose their fragile majority, their support for discarding filibusters has grown. Biden, who\u2019s influential despite having no vote on the matter, has said the tactic is \u201cbeing abused in a gigantic way.\u201d", "Yet Democrats lack the votes to do that. Their two most conservative senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, have opposed a change, arguing the country is better served when Congress can find bipartisan solutions to its problems.", "WHAT IMPACT MIGHT THE JAN. 6 COMMISSION VOTE HAVE ON FILIBUSTERS?", "Democrats consider creating a commission to examine the violent attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters just one of many issues they\u2019re pushing that the public supports. Others in that category include House-passed measures easing voting access, expanding citizenship opportunities for immigrants and curbing gun rights.", "So far, Schumer hasn\u2019t forced Senate votes on many such bills.

Authorities are also investigating the complaints the company conducted research without proper permission.", "The case underscores the resilient rift in polarized Brazil over proper treatment of COVID-19 patients, with many in the nation \u2014 including the unvaccinated president \u2014 bucking global scientific recommendations.

There was no autonomy for the doctor; it was mandatory.\u201d", "The antimalarial has been given glowing endorsements by Bolsonaro and his allies, who are among few remaining global champions for the drug. While a few studies at the pandemic\u2019s onset suggested it might be promising, they were largely conducted in lab dishes, not people.

The Senate committee is also sharing information with prosecutors.", "The lawmakers are also investigating possible fraud in death certificates. In May 2020, the Health Ministry issued guidelines stating that a death stemming from COVID-19 should still be classified as such on a death certificate, even if the patient had stopped testing positive for the virus itself.", "\u201cIf the person was admitted for COVID, COVID has to be on the death certificate,\u201d said Daniel Dourado, a doctor, lawyer and researcher at the University of Sao Paulo.", "But that didn\u2019t always happen.

Similar allegations have emerged regarding Hapvida, the nation\u2019s third-largest healthcare provider, with almost 5 million clients.", "The major newspaper O Globo published messages indicating Hapvida directors pressured doctors to prescribe hydroxychloroquine as recently as January.

Even though the virus tends to be more severe in adults than children, COVID-19 is causing plenty of preventable suffering among youngsters. About 1.9 million kids ages 5 to 11 have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Some 8,300 have been hospitalized, about a third needed intensive care, and at least 94 deaths have been verified.", "That\u2019s not counting the risk of a serious complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can hit kids several weeks after they recovered from even a mild infection.", "Vaccination also promises to help kids more safely resume school and social activities.", "ARE KID DOSES THE SAME SIZE AS ADULT ONES?", "No. Children ages 5 to 11 will receive a third of the dose given to teens and adults. That\u2019s 10 micrograms per shot for youngsters, compared to 30 micrograms per shot for everyone 12 and older. Like everybody else, the younger kids will get two shots, three weeks apart.", "HOW WELL DO THE SHOTS WORK?", "In a study, Pfizer\u2019s pediatric vaccine proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. Vaccinated youngsters developed levels of virus-fighting antibodies as strong as teens and young adults who\u2019d received the full-strength dose.", "ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS?", "In the trial, the 5- to 11-year-olds had some annoying post-shot reactions, including sore arms and fatigue, similar to teens and young adults but were less likely to have fevers. Altogether, the study includes 4,600 youngsters, 3,100 of them given the vaccine and the rest dummy shots. The FDA found no safety concerns.", "WHAT ABOUT RARE PROBLEMS?", "Tens of millions of the larger doses have been given safely to Americans 12 and older. One very rare serious side effect has come to light: heart inflammation.", "These rare reactions have occurred mostly in young men or teens boys, usually after the second dose, and they tend to recover quickly. To put the risk in context, doctors say COVID-19 infection can cause more serious heart inflammation. One theory is that testosterone and puberty play a role, which is partly why experts expect any risk to younger kids would be even lower.", "WHERE ARE THE SHOTS AVAILABLE?", "The shots are being offered at pediatricians\u2019 offices, health clinics and pharmacies. Some school systems also plan to host vaccination clinics, too. Two drugstore chains will start giving the shots this weekend: Walgreens on Saturday and CVS on Sunday.", "CAN MY CHILD GET A FLU SHOT AT THE SAME TIME?", "Yes, the CDC says COVID-19 shots can be given at the same visit as vaccines for the flu, or other routine vaccinations a child \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 may require.", "WHAT IF MY CHILD IS ABOUT TO TURN 12?", "CDC said children should get the dose that\u2019s right for their age on the day of vaccination. So if a child gets the 10-microgram dose for the first shot and then turns 12, the second shot should be the 30-microgram dose.", "SHOULD I JUST WAIT UNTIL THEIR 12TH BIRTHDAY SO BOTH SHOTS ARE THE BIGGER DOSE?", "Pediatricians say not to postpone vaccination because the kid-size dose is effective in that age group.", "IS THE CDC\u2019S MOVE A MANDATE?", "No. The CDC has not mandated vaccinations for youngsters, but recommended them.", "AREN\u2019T ONLY SOME KIDS AT HIGH RISK OF SERIOUS COVID-19?", "Nearly 70% of 5- to 11-year-olds hospitalized for COVID-19 have had other medical problems, including obesity and asthma. But sometimes the otherwise healthy get seriously ill, too. And given the profound social, mental health and educational impact the pandemic has had on youngsters, health authorities made clear that all children should be vaccinated. There also are equity concerns, as more than two-thirds of youngsters who\u2019ve been hospitalized are Black or Hispanic.", "WHAT IF MY CHILD ALREADY HAD COVID-19?", "They still should be vaccinated once they\u2019ve recovered, according the CDC.

They said the legislation\u2019s spending and tax credits for health care, children\u2019s costs, education and other programs would help families cope with rising prices. Most of the bill is paid for with tax boosts on the wealthy and big corporations.", "The legislation\u2019s impact will be \u201creducing costs for ordinary people,\u201d Biden said.", "Republicans said the legislation\u2019s expenditures would further feed inflation, which has been driven by supply chain delays making products less available and spending prompted by a strong underlying economy.", "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said inflation means \u201cthe average American has gotten a pay cut,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is unthinkable that Senate Democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days.\u201d", "Possibly mitigating the political impact of Friday\u2019s inflation numbers was that they were expected and represented a modest rise from October\u2019s 6.2%.", "Adding any additional juice to the economy might worsen inflation. But the extra fiscal stimulus over the next several years in Democrats\u2019 bill would be less than 1% the size of the entire U.S. economy, making its likely inflationary impact mild, said the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.", "Democrats limited the duration of many initiatives in their package to help contain the bill\u2019s price tag. That includes extending enhancements to the child tax credit for just one year and free, universal pre-school for only six years.", "It\u2019s an accounting move both parties have used to make their budget plans seem more affordable \u2014 even though they would like their proposals to be permanent and some may be extended because they are popular. Republicans used such phaseouts robustly for their big tax cuts in 2001 and 2017.", "\u201cIf you believe these programs go away after one, two or three years, you shouldn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, who requested the CBO estimates. He said the bill\u2019s higher price tag and rising inflation meant Democrats\u2019 legislation would be \u201clethal to the economy and lethal to your paycheck.\u201d", "Democrats argued the estimated added $3 trillion cost was bogus because if they decided to seek any future extensions of their initiatives, they would propose savings to pay for them.", "As if sharing a script, Psaki called the GOP claims \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans were using \u201cfake scores based on mistruths.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the numbers \u201ca phony score of an imaginary bill.\u201d", "Outside groups have produced similar estimates about the legislation\u2019s cost if its programs were permanent.

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., has also pushed to trim the measure.", "Democrats have also had differences over how to ease limits on federal tax deductions that people can take on state and local taxes.

But with kids now back in school and the extra-contagious delta variant causing a huge jump in pediatric infections, many parents are anxiously awaiting vaccinations for their younger children.", "For elementary school-aged kids, Pfizer tested a much lower dose \u2014 a third of the amount that\u2019s in each shot given now. Yet after their second dose, children ages 5 to 11 developed coronavirus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teenagers and young adults getting the regular-strength shots, Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president, told The Associated Press.", "The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects \u2014 such as sore arms, fever or achiness \u2014 that teens experience, he said.", "\u201cI think we really hit the sweet spot,\u201d said Gruber, who\u2019s also a pediatrician.", "Gruber said the companies aim to apply to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the month for emergency use in this age group, followed shortly afterward with applications to European and British regulators.", "", ", FDA chief Dr. Peter Marks told the AP that once Pfizer turns over its study results, his agency would evaluate the data \u201chopefully in a matter of weeks\u201d to decide if the shots are safe and effective enough for younger kids.", "An outside expert said scientists want to see more details but called the report encouraging.", "\u201cThese topline results are very good news,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.

Her mother, Dr. Nisha Gandhi, a critical care physician at Englewood Hospital, enrolled Maya in the Pfizer study at Rutgers University.

The FDA required what is called an immune \u201cbridging\u201d study: evidence that the younger children developed antibody levels already proven to be protective in teens and adults. That\u2019s what Pfizer reported Monday in a press release, not a scientific publication. The study still is ongoing, and there haven\u2019t yet been enough COVID-19 cases to compare rates between the vaccinated and those given a placebo \u2014 something that might offer additional evidence.", "The study isn\u2019t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men. The FDA\u2019s Marks said the pediatric studies should be large enough to rule out any higher risk to young children. Pfizer\u2019s Gruber said once the vaccine is authorized for younger children, they\u2019ll be carefully monitored for rare risks just like everyone else.", "A second U.S. vaccine maker, Moderna, also is studying its shots in elementary school-aged children.
